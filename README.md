# Continuum-Robot-Forward-Kinematic-Constant-Curvature
A forward kinematic for a continuum robot with a variable number of segments of any length. This model uses the constant curvature assumption meaning each segment bends in the shape of a circle segment. Curvature here is defined as one divided by the radius of such a circle.
